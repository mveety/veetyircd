	This is the IRC server some mates, mates of mates, etc used to talk to
each other, hang out, etc. Work started in 2008 or so and ran until 2015
or so. This release is just the guts of the IRC server. We added many more
features and services over the years (which you can see the vestiges of in
places) which are not included, and the server itsself has had some
major changes since birth.
	This release is an update of 0.4.2 which adds the mnesia auth_server,
starts using rebar3 for building/deployment/etc, and removed all of the
hacks and servers to make the dets auth_server "work" over multiple nodes
plus some bug fixes. This release is more or less functionally identical
with 0.4.2, though. In general, I never really removed major features
(like the dets backends) and generally I kept them up to date, but they
are untested and may not work. TLS, as well, is a mostly untested feature.
We connected to these machines exclusively through a vpn so while it was
added, it was never really used.

	The server only implements a subset of irc which we deemed good enough
for our uses and completely ignores the server to server parts of the
protocol because it just didn't make sense for us.
